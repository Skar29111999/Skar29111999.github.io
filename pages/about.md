I am a UX student at Wilfrid Laurier University with a Fine Arts background. As a budding designer, I have faced many challenges on the way which have allowed me to explore many assets, resources and experiences.

<br>The aim of the display  of projects is not to exhibit the quality of the projects but the steady progress as a Designer. The aim is to motivate budding designers and artists while introducing the visitors to a relatively new stream of Design. <br><br>
