<br> The goal of my project was to create an e-learning experience (website) to bring together the budding UX students and help them learn more about Behavioral Economics. This project was aimed at creating a whole community for UX students and helping them gain knowledge and useful information while gradually eliminating man misconceptions related to Behavioral Economics. The aim was to make learning a delightful experience and not merely a task for the completion of degree.
