<br>The prototype is that of a Companion App for a Video Security Door-phone. This app has been built with respect to the requirements of potential users of the console developed by the firm. This is a project initiated by an Indian firm, Acktron Security Systems (Delhi) (and thus, a fully functional prototype for the app/ all the artboards cannot be uploaded online). <br>

<br>The project was a challenge in terms of research since video door phone is not  common yet and to determine the functionalities of the app was as good as decding the needs of the user. 

<br>Another hurdle was the fact that unlike the West, security door phones is highly uncommon and therefore a possible need/want within the target is userr is unexplored. This led to many skeptics around the technology in terms of how resistent will the technology be from exterrnal hacking.

#### <u> My Angle </u>

*Though the usability testing of the application was successful, the users were not convinced enough to buy the product in the near future, partially the reason being their skeptics around the use of technology for the securrity of the entrance to a house. Since, my role was confined till around the designing of the app, I was unable to work further on the product to make it more desirable to the users.*
