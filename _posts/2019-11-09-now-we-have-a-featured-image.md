  It was difficult to make the project environmentally sustainable while making
  the structure durable enough for pets to inhabit. The solution we came across
  was not a different material but a different way to process an existing
  material. On my visit to LA (Dec, 2018), I found a wending machine which
  crushed glass to fine granules and redeposited it to the beaches all over
  California. This way we could manufacture a durable product while providing
  users with an environmental way of disposing the product/material.
