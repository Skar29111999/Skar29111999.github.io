  It was difficult to make the project environmentally sustainable while making
  the structure durable enough for pets to inhabit. The solution we came across
  was not a different material but a different way to process an existing
  material. On my visit to LA (Dec, 2018), I found a wending machine which
  crushed glass to fine granules and redeposited it to the beaches all over
  California. This way we could manufacture a durable product while providing
  users with an environmental way of disposing the product/material.

The aim of the project was to include pets (specifically small) within the owner's lifestyle. Pet negligence is a serious issue catching pace in urban areas where life is too fast paced to share time with others (including pets). This leads to a stressful enviornment for pets to grow healthy. 

<br>The solution was construction of a structure which could reside two different animals at once. The best example to showcase the diversity of the idea was to build an aquarium with a guine pig cage. 

<br> To include the pets (product) as an impoortant part of the owners daily life, idea of modular design was integrated in the design during the design process. This allowed the product to attach drawers and baskets via sliding mechanism.
